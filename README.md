# Phoenix 1.3 with Bootstrap 4 and Font Awesome 4.7

This is an example of using Phoenix with Bootstrap.  One of the example Bootstrap templates is being used.  The main changes to the default install is in /assets/package.json, /assets/brunch-config.js, and /assets/css/* (namely that app.css was renamed to app.scss and some custom css was imported).

To start Phoenix:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
